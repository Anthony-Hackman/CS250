*These prompts are some of the “essential questions” for the Computer Science program. You will encounter these questions in different courses throughout the program. They are open-ended and meant to help you engage with “big ideas” in the field. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.*

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

With Agile in mind, to interpret I first gather user requirements. This will start directly engaging with stakeholders or users through interviews, surveys, or shadowing. Engaging with stakeholders and understanding their goals is critical. While in this gathering phase it is crucial to avoid technical jargon/slang because our goal is to understand the context points or objectives.

User stories are short, simple ways to capture requirements from the end user’s perspective. For each user story we define acceptance criteria/clear conditions that must be met for a story to be considered completed.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Agile promotes iterative and incremental delivery, which means breaking the work into smaller chunks (sprints) and regularly reviewing progress with stakeholders. Scrum is an Agile methodology that uses sprint planning, daily stand up meetings, sprint reviews/retrospectives to keep the team aligned, transparent, and continuously improving.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Effective collaboration is the center of the team maintaining open communication, respect, and accountability. As a team, share our progress and challenges openly, offer help when others are stuck, and ask for assistance when you need it (help yourself before others). Encourage diverse viewpoints, everyone has different experiences. Stay focused on the shared product vision and strive for continuous learning to better ourselves. By fostering a supportive environment, the team remains productive, innovative, and aligned with user needs.
